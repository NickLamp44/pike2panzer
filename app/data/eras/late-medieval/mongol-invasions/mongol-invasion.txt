    "The Mongol invasions of Japan were two major military campaigns launched by Kublai Khan, the Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan Dynasty in China, aiming to conquer Japan and expand Mongol influence eastward. The invasions occurred in 1274 (Bun’ei Campaign) and 1281 (Kōan Campaign). Despite numerical superiority, the Mongols were repelled by Japanese samurai defenders, strategic fortifications, and severe weather, most famously typhoons known as “kamikaze” (divine winds). These invasions were significant for shaping Japanese military culture, fortification strategies, and national identity.",
